It is a relatively short walk to the Point and to the reward of a fabulous view.   Amazingly it was not crowded at around 10 am on a Monday.  There are a number of vantage points to enjoy the view.  Definitely take the time to get a different view of Yosemite and the valley.  There are bathrooms in the parking lot.You can hike to Sentinel Dome from Glacier point.  We chose to drive down to the Taft Point / Sentinel Dome Trail head to hike to Sentinel Point and then Taft Point.  It is a but longer of a hike to Sentinel Dome from the Taft Point trail head than from Glacier point but supposedly not as steep.  The drive to Glacier Point from the valley is about an hour (30 miles).  There is no free shuttle to the point only a pay for tour.\",\n",
