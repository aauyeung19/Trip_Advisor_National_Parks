      "Review:  I've never been especially enthusiastic about stuff like camping or the Great Outdoors in general, but Yosemite Valley really is a magical place. And to get the full effect you have to do at least one or two of the day hikes that ascend from the valley floor. Vernal Fall, for example, is only visible after you make a two- mile hike up a narrow,rugged, serpentine gorge east of the main valley. The trail isn't lengthy, but it is fairly steep---most people will be huffing and puffing by the time they reach the fall. The scenery, however, is awesome---I felt like I was somewhere near the entrance to Moria in Middle Earth. Your first glimpse of the fall comes after climbing a steep staircase of flat cut stones that have been laid in a slope above the Merced River. (I was there in April, when the river is high. It's not a big river, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in fury.) At the top of the staircase the trail makes a hairpin turn around a towering cliff and Vernal Fall comes into view. The cliff recedes away from you and curves to the left, forming a sort of sheer-sided half-bowl. Near the far end of the bowl the Merced roars off the top of the cliff and plunges straight down three hundred feet, making a huge cloud of spray that hovers in the bowl, like a watery genie. Because I was there so early in the year, many of the Park trails were still closed. So, obviously, I didn't see everything the Park has to offer. However, Vernal Fall, and the Mist Trail leading to it, were the high points of my visit. Above excellent---sublime.\n",
      "Review:  We visited Yosemite for four days and had entered the lottery to climb Half Dome. I was pretty disappointed when we didn't get it, but what ya gonna do? We wanted to do a long hike and decided on the Mist Trail to the Panorama Trail to Glacier Point, and then back down to the valley via Four Mile Trail. Mist Trail was AWESOME! And the mist is no joke...you get soaked! We had raincoats, and I was glad we did to protect my camera. Besides the amazing experience of climbing up (a lot of the trail is steep stairs) through the mist and seeing the beautiful Vernal and Nevada Falls, there were rainbows in the canyon, so close that if they had been tangible, we could have touched them. It was truly magical. While we went on to the Panorama and Four Mile trail, which was almost 14 miles, if you just do the Mist Trail and want to come back down, I would recommend descending on the John Muir Trail, which is to the right of the Mist Trail. The Mist Trail is very steep and slippery and I would imagine difficult to descend. IMO, this is one hike not to be missed!\n",
      "Review:  We did this walk first in the park. I am 64 and it was very strenuous for me.  I made it to the bridge and had to stop...some of the rest of my party went all the way to the top to the falls....they climbed the steps up by the falls.\n",
      "Review:  This was indeed the best experience of our visit. We were apprehensive about our 7 year old son hiking 1.5 miles steep hike. However he showed lot of courage and hiked all the way to top of the Vernal fall. As you get view of vernal fall it becomes pretty exciting and that's what separates it from any other hike. You do get wet however that experience of mist is amazing. We also saw an old woman climbing all the way to the top and going outside the trail path on a few times. I would not do that but I definitely admire her guts. We did not want to risk our son getting sick so we decided to spend some time at the top of vernal falls and return back. When he grows up, we will target to go all the way to the top of Nevada falls. If you have one day in Yosemite valley, stsrt with glacier point, then mist trail and end it with visit to Yosemite falls. If you have more than one day, you can add more to your itinerary.\n",
      "Review:  We set out thinking this would be a sedate easy hike.... We did 10miles in the end and it was quite tough! Very steep in places but amazing when you get to the top of Nevada falls!! Make sure you are fit if you do the full hike, and take lots of water!!!\n",

      "Review:  As a result of COVID the trail is currently one way, meaning you must make a loop via either Clark Point or up to Nevada Falls and down the John Muir trail. We elected to do the loop up to Nevada Falls and down John Muir. For us, we found this trail to be challenging but beautiful and worth it. As the shuttles buses are not running in 2020, we parked in Curry Village and walked in - which adds about 2 miles round trip (mile in feels like a piece of cake, mile back was long as we were tired!). Trail starts out paved with a series of long switch backs up to the foot bridge. This was moderately easy. At the foot bridge there is a water station to refill water bottles and a flush toilet. We then continued on to Vernal Falls with more switch backs and then up the granite steps. In August, we didn’t get any mist and the steps were dry and traffic was one way, which made it nice. Even with a lower flow, the waterfall was beautiful. We took breaks along the way to catch our breath and take pictures and enjoy the view. Some people were powering up the stairs like it was nothing - but we definitely had to take stops - the altitude and heat (even starting at 7am) made it more difficult for us. Making it to the top of Vernal Falls was moderate for us - and very beautiful! I can see why this is marked moderate - if we had turned around at this point it would have been. We continued to Nevada Falls - which started as a nice meandering path beside the pools and forest before you hit the next set of steep rocky switchbacks. They were much steeper and we needed some more breaks to get to the top. The top was beautiful and made the climb worth it! Took our pictures and stuck our feet in the water. For us, the track down was harder on our knees and legs than the way up. Despite the extra distance, I’m glad we did the John Muir trail, as I wouldn’t have wanted to go back down all those steps on my knees. We were definitely tired and sore by the time we reached our car. All in, I’m glad we did it and would have regretted it if we hadn’t done the full Nevada Falls loop. It was just more difficult for us than I thought it would be.\n",

If you go later, a bus runs from further down the road to the Glacier Point car park.When you arrive at the top and walk the last part, you are presented with an absolutely amazing panorama with Half Dome in front of you.Small gift/food shop and toilets are available near the summit and car park.The drive back down offers fantastic views too, and if you are lucky as we were, you may see some bears and their cubs on the roadside!\n",

The cables would have been too much for my small 12 year old to do safely and my fear of heights kept me back as well.

      "Review:  I won't repeat much of what I'm sure you have already read about this hike, so I'll focus on the logistics that worked for my husband and me during our recent hike. Yes, it's very difficult and tiring, but absolutely worth every second. We drove into the Valley and parked at the trailhead parking lot just before Happy Isles. We then walked to the starting point across the bridge from Happy Isles, arriving at 5am (it was still dark in early June, but not for long). We elected to hike up the Mist Trail and to get to the Half Dome subdome was long and arduous. The park ranger who checks permits is stationed at the subdome, well before you even get close to the cables. Once you're checked in, you need to get up and over the subdome using a series of high steps along steep switchbacks. We began this portion at 10:30am and these switchbacks are located in the blazing, hot sun with little shade. At this point, the air is also feeling pretty thin up here so we ended up taking five steps, resting, five steps, resting. Everyone around us looked to be in the same boat. My advice would be to stop, eat a good snack, and hydrate before you leave the shaded area where the park ranger stands. This will really help push you over the subdome! When you get to the top at last, you are faced with the final portion consisting of the cables.The cables really were not that bad, as long as you went slow and were careful. My method was to stop and take a short break on every wooden board and to keep looking directly in front of me. When I reached the top, I was overjoyed - it was one of the best feelings! We made it to the top at 11:30am and stayed on the summit to rest, take pictures, and eat lunch (45 minutes total). We then began to head down the cables and hike back to our car. Going down the cables took a bit longer as there were more people arriving at that time of day and a hiker froze halfway down the cables. Thank goodness a good samaritan came in to save the day and coax the fearful hiker down. We hiked down the same path and took a nice break once we reached the flat portion of the trail by the river. We continued on and took the John Muir Trail down (instead of the Mist Trail), reaching our car at 6:30pm. We took the next day off from hiking, but were otherwise in good shape!Lastly, in terms of gear, my husband and I each carried our own pack containing, 3.5 Liters of water, 1 Gatorade, a banana, two PB&J sandwiches, trail mix, and 1 granola bar. We certainly needed every last drop of liquid considering there are no water stops on the trail except for 0.8 miles from the trailhead. We also carried hats and used hiking poles which I would absolutely recommend. Just remember, there are times when you might feel like there is no way you'll make it to the top, but you will! Take breaks early and often and enjoy yourself!\n",
      "Review:  Went up Half Dome in early June of 2014. A fair bit of warning, this is not an easy hike. It wild test your resolve. That being said, if you are semi-active you can do this. Its just a matter of how long you want to be exposed to the elements. The best advice I can give for the night before is drink lots of water. I drank 1.5 liters an hour before bed. I then drank another 1.5 liters at our 4 AM wake up call. I easily drank 6-7 liters during the hike and probably could have drank more.We started at the trail head at around 5 AM, since it was June, we didn't need flashlights. The first part of the trail is a slowly raising grade of paved trail. You will get to the falls bridge and reach a water fountain. I drank as much as I possibly could while there, because you are about start gaining elevation. We took the Mist Trail up and down, which is considered the more difficult route. If stamina or knees are a concern, you can bypass the Falls and take a slower but longer trail up part ways. It would be a shame though, as missing Vernal or Nevada Falls would be a shame. After a few hours of stairs and other granite steps, you will be at the top Nevada Falls. Its a perfect place to stop and take a break. A good piece of advice is take food that you will enjoy eating. I took cashews, granola, craisons, m&ms, jerky and a few Snickers bars. Drink lots of water and apply sunscreen.From Nevada Falls, you will enter little Yosemite Valley. In the morning its a quick jaunt through a cool mountain valley. At the end, you will start gaining election with a long winding path which takes you to the Sub Dome. This is the area I had the most trouble. Its a constant grade so its hard to take a break. Its devious in that its most of the time the grade is slight, but it just keeps coming. This is going to be the end of tree coverage; apply sunscreen!Eventually you will get out of the trees and be at the beginning of the Sub Dome. The Sub Dome is very sheer, you are climbing stairs and on all sides are sheer drops. Take your time, and pay attention to where you step. At the very end of the sub dome, the stairs end, and leave you with very little direction as where to go. You have about 100 yards of granite to move up and you will be at the Saddle. Nothing is going to prepare you for the site of seeing the cables. Its pretty much pulling yourself up a wall. Take it slow, use the cables(pushing down on them while lifting yourself up) and take gloves. The top is indescribable. The sense of accomplishment you get is truly amazing. But you are only halfway there. Getting down is faster, but a bit scarier. Its easiest to go down facing backwards. Here is the only place on the tail where you have to truly trust others. Going down, a man yanked a pole out and proceeded to have a bit of a freak out. Someone had to go and put the pole back in. Be smart, and courteous; you will be faster than some, but slower than others.Going down the Sub Dome is just as precious as going up. Be careful, and use your hiking poles, if you have some(get some!), they will save wear on your knees and give you balance.In the afternoon, Little Yosemite Valley is a lot hotter and more dusty, so water is key. We had to stop at the Merced River and get more water. We used a charcoal filter. Once you get to the end of the Valley, you will start running into more traffic. Nevada Falls is considered a tough day hike, so there will be a lot of people stopping there and resting before making their descent. This part seems a lot steeper. Be careful and watch out for slippery steps. The rest of the trail gets easier. Once at the water fountain, drink up and its an easy paved trail down. Once down, celebrate with a beer, or other beverage of choice and you are guaranteed, whatever you eat, will be the best meal you had in months!\n",
      "Review:  This is quite a challenging hike from an endurance perspective. The hike is a 5,000 vertical foot climb and 18 miles round trip. The majority of the hike is a very gentle climb, but the sub-dome and dome themselves can be a bit challenging. The sub-dome is approximately 1 mile of steps cute into the granite of the half-dome. This is challenging because you are literally climbing straight up after having hiked 8 miles. Also you are on exposed rock, which can be quite hot. This part of the climb is not horrendously difficult. Just be prepared for the climb. The dome gets a bad wrap for being daunting. To give you some context, the cables stretch about 300 yards up the side of half dome. The grade is ~40-45% and the surface is somewhat slippery. To some this sounds dangerous, but it is actually much safer than it sounds. There is a reason that the park allows all climbers to register without clearing credentials first. The real trick to the cables is the traffic. There are a lot of people sharing he cables and the walk way is only 4 feet wide. People go up and come down in the same channel. This leads to significant congestion. You can still navigate. You will just need stand sideways to let others pass at times. For the cables make sure you bring gloves. Also, do not underestimate the weather. If there is any sign of rain do not attempt the cables and if you see rain at the top go down right away. The cables can get congested and you do not want to be stuck there in a storm. Furthermore, the subdome is exposed. You need no less than two to three hours to get up and down the sub-dome and dome itself. This means if you see clouds and you are climbing the sub-dome, wait for them to pass. Follow the ranger warnings. Overall, the hike is not to be missed. You will pass both Vernal and Nevada falls on the way up, which are beautiful in their own right. Let alone the view from the top of the rock. You're going to love it!\n",
      "Review:  We were lucky enough to snag a half dome permit 2 days before the hike (daily lottery.)  We parked at the happy isle parking lot and reached the trail head at 4am, took us 5 hours to reach the top of half dome.  It was pitch black out for about 2 hours...all we used was 1 head lamp and that was plenty of light.  Its a well marked easy trailer...you dont exactly need a spot light to find your way.  We took the mist trail to John Muir trail up...then the falls trail back.  The falls trail is much more difficult.  I couldnt imagine taking that trail up in the pitch black.  Its much more difficult terrain (all steep steps and switchbacks.).  No thanks.  Its a mile shorter but much more strenuous.  Take the John Muir trail up!The trail up through the John Muir way is really easy and not very strenuous at all.  I hurt my knee earlier in the week and had no issues, didnt have to use walking poles, etc.  I do about zero cardio at the gym and was not breathing heavy at all...until the last half mile.The last half mile is when you start to to ascend the sub dome then half dome.  Sub dome is a lot of switchbacks with stairs...pretty darn steep.  Once you climb that and arrive at the cables take a couple minute break to get a drink and relax just to be safe.  If you didnt bring gloves grab some up by the cables near the rock.  You wont miss it.  If you're early enough there should be plenty of pairs to choose from...if you get there later in the day they may all be taken.The cables themselves/half dome is pretty intimidating.  It is really steep.  At first you may be frightened and unsure of yourself but as you go you'll get in a groove as to how to grip the cables and move up the slick granite wall.  I had bald sneakers and it was a little difficult because I kept slipping.  I did change into my other shoes I brought along on the way down and they gripped much better.  Just take a break on each of the boards on the way up if you need to.  And whatever you do...do not let go of the cables and do no go outside of the cables like some people do!  Its slopped on each side...if you start to fall off you have a very small chance of survival.  It took us about 15 minutes to climb the cables.  Once at the top enjoy yourself and eat/drink.  There are also small critters that try to steal your food if you leave stuff out unattended...so if you're going to leave your backpack behind make sure everything is sealed.  Or you can do what I did and feel the little guys.  They're funny and I had plenty of food to go around.  And for the goobers who like to say that feeding wildlife is killing them...uh news flash...these little critters arent apex predators!  It doesnt matter if they become dependent on people feeding them.  If they want food all they have to do is walk under a tree and pick up a nut you dummy.  They arent chasing down other animals to prey on.  Zip it.On the way down the cables you'll want to go backwards, gripping both sides of the cable.  You'll also get in a groove and fly down the cables.  Before you know it you'll be back at the bottom looking up.  Some other maybe helpful things:2 of us shared 3 liters of water along with a gatorade and 2 small bottles of water.  When we arrived back at the hotel I pulled out my bladder bag and there was maybe a gulp of water left.  We planned it just right.  If we had to do it again Id bring an additional 2 liters of water to be safe.  But everyone is different so you may need less than this...you may need more.Shoes:  Like I said I wore comfortable semi bald shoes and had no issues till scaling half dome.  You do not need hiking boots designed to withstand a nuclear blast.  Wear something comfortable.  When I got to the bottom of the cables I switched out of my \"hiking\" sneakers and back to my more comfortable worn out shoes for the hike home.  Even going the falls trail which is steep...had no issues.  Also, you're not going to experience much water walking on the trail up and back...so theres no need for those gore tex leathery hot on your feet material that can deflect bullets.  Any comfy sneaker is fine.  No one will care about your $300 footwear.  After 16+ miles you'll be wishing for your cheapo comfy wilson shoes from the dollar store.Some have mentioned not to bring a heavy camera (dslr.)  My question is...why not?  We carried one and it didnt bother us one bit.  Not everyone wants to view pictures on a 4 inch cell phone.Also...do not play in the water anywhere near the top of a waterfall.  Better yet stay the hell out of the water...and for parents, keep your kids out of the water unless you're at the bottom of the valley.  There are signs everywhere about the dangers.  You will be really hot by the end of the walk and a quick dip in the creek is tempting...do not do it.  People die every single year in Yosemite because of this.  Actually more people die from waterfalls in yosemite than from half dome.  For those who die and are old enough to know the dangers of getting in the water...well thats just Darwin at work.Thats about all i have...you do not need to be in super shape to do this hike.  Like I said...15 miles of this trail is easy...the last .5 up and .5 down is tough...so anyone thinking they're awesome for doing this hike needs a reality check.  Just pace yourself, start early enough, and have fun.\n",

      "Review:  Hiked half dome in July.  Took us 11 hrs via our campsite in Upper Pines.  It was a nice day to start.  But it got hot in the later afternoon.  Take a hat and sunscreen.  Plenty of water and food to keep you fueled.  I bought garden gloves with rubber on the palms.  So glad I did or my hands would've been raw on the cables.  Take a headlamp for the early morning ascent and just enjoy every step.  You will pass beautiful places along the way.  Savor it!  I'm already planning on doing it next year!  Sub dome is a challenge, but fun and scrambling along on some of the rocks was awesome!  Be in shape-this hike is hardcore.   You will love it!  Make sure you have a permit, the Rangers will be there to check.  \n",
      "Review:  I was not fully prepared for the idea of hiking half dome but thankfully I was in shape. 6 hours of 5000' elevation gain over  8-9 miles which on paper is possible ...many do it in two days but alas we did it in one. There are many hours of uphill grueling grind and then moments of flatlands ... It is so beautiful and you will take lots of pics. After about hour 5 and you're tired and ready to give up you round the corner and the cables come in to view. The next hour though is the toughest. You climb sub dome and your legs are fried and then get to the cables and use up all your grip strength... Nobody clips in as you would have to clip and unclip on the cable too often but man I'm surprised you don't have to clip in ... It's awesome on the top with amazing views and great photo ops. FaceTime your friends if you have Verizon it's a great signal! Ok you need to get down... It took about 5 hours down. We went slow and had great convos ... Don't get hurt going down because your body is tired at this point ... Just take your time and watch your footing. I saw many shapes and sizes, not sure who all made it but many were struggling. If you are are afraid of heights the cables may be a no go for you but would suck to hike 5+ hours to find out you can't finish the last 30 minutes! I met young old women men who did not do the cables as they were too scared . Keep that in mind. Pack 4 liters of water at minimum. I brought Gatorade and about 3000 calories of different hiking foods. Have fun be safe take amazing pictures ... Oh and you need a permit to climb the cables ... Lottery system \n",
      "Review:  Since I visited yosemite last year, hiking half dome has been on my bucket list. I was delighted to achieve this ambition this summer. I applied in the march lottery for a permit and was gutted not to get one. Luckily I was staying in the valley for 5 days so I had plenty of chances with the daily lottery and got one on the second attempt. There's plenty of info on the NPS website on how to do this. Once I'd got my permit I made sure I was prepared (I'd been doing research for months in advance). I had a camelbak with 2 litres in, a 500ml bottle of water and a 500ml Gatorade. So 3 litres of fluid and I used it ALL! Make sure you come prepared! There is no more filtered water after the vernal falls footbridge, which is only about 1 mile into the trek. I filled up here on the way up and way back, so probably consumed about 4 litres total and could probably have done with more. I know some people bring filtration devices with them. Other than fluids, I had loads of snacks and a full lunch to eat at the top. I also had a compass just in case, my phone, solar power charger, head torch, torch, gloves with rubber palms, energy gels, go pro, hat and suncream! Like I said, be overly prepared!My day started at 4 am for breakfast and I left at 5 as I wanted to be back for lunch. The shuttle isn't running at this point, so I walked from curry village to the trail head at happy isles, which I'd estimate is about a mile. It was dark until about 6am, so I was walking the trail in the dark up to the top of vernal falls. Was spectacular seeing the moon set and and sun rise!I went up the mist trail on the way up and it was almost deserted (used John muir on the way back as the mist trail would have been very busy). There are then toilet facilities at the top of the falls. It's fairly easy to follow the trail, just look for what looks like the most obvious route, and when you've crossed the footbridge in between vernal and Nevada falls, if you're not sure, just just take the left(ish) route. You're given a little respite from the incline when you get to little yosemite valley, which is about half way. Here you walk through the woods, which is a bit sandy, so stick to the side to avoid wasting energy. You then weave up through the woods and eventually break through the tree line. I saw more people here as they camp over night in little Yosemite valley to give themselves a head start. Next is the switch backs up the subdome, which I found hard work! The reward is that you get to see half dome in all its glory. The  360 views are quite ridiculous too and some of the best and most awe-inspiring I've ever seen. Take a little breather if you need to and get those gloves on ready for the cables, even with gloves I still got blisters and calluses on my hands. If you do forget them, sometimes people leave old ones at the bottom of the cables, but I wouldn't rely on that. I wore trail running shoes and they were just about sufficient for the steep and smooth granite surface. I'd imagine trainers wouldn't cut it and hiking boots would be best. As it was still early, there were only a handful of people on the cables, however it's important that you're sensible around other people on there - give them time, don't rush them and make sure you manoeuvre around them carefully if necessary. Do not go up there if it's raining or could rain, that's very dangerous and there is a sign explaining this. Once you reach the top, you realise the sheer size of it, its is HUGE. So huge in fact, I put my bag down, went for a wander and couldn't find it again! Spent at least half an hour looking for it, so be careful. Super views of Yosemite valley and glacier point from up here. I spent a while relaxing eating my lunch ready for the return trip. Going down the cable is HARDER! I went backwards/sideways. With both hands on the left cable I lead with my left foot sideways and took the pressure on that and eased/shuffled/slipped my way down.  I hate walking down hill, so once off the cables and off the subdome I walked/ran whenever I could to maintain the momentum and save my knees. Worth noting that the nearest toilet on the way down is at the top of Nevada falls. Taking the John muir trail down seemed to take forever. I got back at 12:55PM so achieved my aim of getting back for lunch. Obviously the shuttles were working by this point so I could take that back to curry village. Some people take 10-12 or even 14 hours to do this hike, however I was only travelling for about 6 and a half hours, so you can do other stuff for the rest of the day too. This kept me out of the sun for too long too!Before I forget, when I got to to cables (about 8:30AM) there was no ranger to check permits,  however when I was heading down, he was there at the base of the subdome to check, a printout or a screenshot on your phone is fine. With my additional walk at the start, wandering around a lot and taking the John muir trail back down, the 15-16 mile hike turned into a 20 mile hike. You don't need to be superman by any means, but at least have a basic level of fitness. Such an adventure and would do it again in a heartbeat. \n",
      "Review:  Half Dome is one if the elusive feather that you would want in hiking crown.Hike: The trail is long, can be shorten down using Mist trail instead of John Muir trail, however this trail is very steep. We went up using Mist trail and took John Muir trail on our way down. It's especially useful, if your knees are complaining.Difficulty: Extremely strenuous, especially  if you are a new hiker.Precaution: Take at least 4 liters of water with you and have a water purifer with you, so you can refill at stream near Nevada fall (Do not fill water without water purifer).  from the fall). Have ample amount of food and head lights are a must. One of our friends are felt had extreeme knee pain while ascending and we had to hike down in the dark. \n",

      "Review:  It's been years since we visited Yosemite.  The valley with the crowds and traffic during \"the season\" no longer beckons us from San Francisco - we have memories of quieter times and fewer backpackers on the back-country trails.  We'll go back during off-season, some time.So we went to check out the revamped Mariposa Grove -- with the new emphasis on hiking rather than on the old Disneyland-like tram to ride through the giant sequoias.We stayed for 2 nights at a nearby lodge/hotel and arrived at the Yosemite south gate and shuttle parking lot to the grove at 8:15am on a Friday before most schools let out for summer (June 7). There were only a few cars in the parking lot; a 15 minute wait for the shuttle.  The guide office wasn't open and trail maps not available, so we took photos of the trail map posted on the wall.The details from here on are for people looking for suggestions of how to spend an easy day in the grove.  We're in our 60s, do a lot of walking, and did not find what we did as \"strenuous,\" even though that's what the NPS trail markers calls our route.  We just kept hiking because it seemed relatively easy, felt good, and we had energy and the desire to do more. And brought lunch and water.   Total time was about 6 hours and about 7 miles.  We spent a lot of time dawdling -- taking in what we were looking at... and taking pictures.  **Note: whenever possible, take one of the perimeter trails or similar less-traveled trails. If you're seeking peace and solitude in the giant sequoias, this is probably more what you're looking for.  They are well-maintained.  We didn't see any evidence that the trails have been used with horses, despite the signs marking this as a horse trail.  There were very few people on the perimeter trails when we were there on a weekday with school still in session.We started the regular Big Trees Loop trail (easy, about 2 miles total), then kept going on the Mariposa Grove Trail at the Grizzly Giant.  But the MGT is basically an old tram road with the asphalt stripped off -- and not very interesting.  So, on the MGT, across from the branch off to the California Tunnel Tree, we headed onto a smaller trail to the \"Perimeter Trail\" and kept going to the Mariposa Grove Cabin.  The perimeter trail was well maintained and more what we were looking for: a sweet hike through the woods on a narrow hiking trail.  Not really \"strenuous\" in our book... just a moderate grade climb uphill.    The Mariposa Grove was inspiring... and the cabin story fascinating.  We got great suggestions from the Conservancy volunteer there about trails.From the cabin, we took a portion of the Guardian's Loop trail to the Telescope Tree and the Fallen Wawona Tunnel Tree, shifting whenever possible to cutoff trails or the Perimeter Trail.  Then, from the Galen Clark Tree, took the Mariposa Grove Trail (old tram road) the 1/2 mile to Wawona Point.  The view from Wawona Point is worth the walk -- and it's a great place to have a lunch or snack that you brought.Heading back, we avoided the road-wide Mariposa Grove Trail for the lesser-traveled trails.  At the Faithful Couple tree, we took the smaller trail until it joined up with the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail, then back to the start and shuttle stop.  We got back to the shuttle parking lot at 2:30 and saw quite a few open parking spaces.  Then headed back to the lodge/hotel and a beeline to the hot tub and pool.So why give this a 4 star instead of 5?  I love this place, but giving it a rating involves comparing.  And to me there's nothing that beats the intimacy, beauty, and peace of Muir Woods and the redwood grove in the early morning hours before 8:00am and the crowds begin to arrive.  Maybe it's the number of groves/trees in that tiny amount of valley space, or the moisture from the fog, or the way the redwoods climb to the sky (redwoods are taller, sequoias are thicker).  This close-up intimacy of Muir Woods is a very different experience than the much wider area and grandeur-of-a-different-sort of Mariposa Grove, where you happen upon groves of giant sequoias in the dry elevations of the Sierras.  It's all good.\n",
      "Review:  Ok, I have been visiting Yosemite since 1965, so this was not my first trip. I am not a fan of the old vendor and the problem with who owns the names of the iconic places. But this trip was pretty strange. It is June and the schools are out but there were no crowds anywhere I went. The Merced and waterfalls are full and beautiful. The valley is pretty green and with the new traffic circles and flow, the parking and driving was pretty easy.The curry village area was clean and the stores are well maintained. The only issue is that the employees seem to be unhappy and just not focused. The YOSEMITE merchandise is bland and without any imagination.But the park itself was fantastic. i am going back in august and I know the falls will most likely be ribbons but it is place to just relax.Advice hike out of the valley on one of the many trails, once you get a few hundred feet in there are no crowds. Bring plenty of water and just take your time. Slow and steady wins the race here.\n",
      "Review:  I went up on July 4th 2013, in the middle of a heatwave. The recommended gallon of water per person was not enough in warm temperatures, I'd have taken a gallon and a half per person in hindsight. There is a drinking fountain about half a mile into the mist trail, and that's the only one.The mist trail at the bottom is nice, after that it's a bit of a slog. The little Yosemite valley is devoid of much shelter or anything much to see. The river is nice but you quickly move away from it. On top the views from the subdome are nice (three way panoramas, North West South). The view from the top of half dome is not as nice, as you can't get a panorama because the dome is so big it blocks some of your view (although you can get the east view to El Capitan). Also, the best views in this section of the park are the ones looking at half dome, and from here you clearly can't see it. Personally I preferred the views from Sentinel Dome and that can be reached in under an hour from Glacier Point.The cables are fine, but steeper than they look in pictures. People in tennis shoes struggled for a lack of traction, so don't wear them if you have anything better. We arrived at the cables at about 12:30, and there was no line at all, it was very quiet, but maybe the heat thinned out the crowds. As we were coming down the cables we heard thunder, there were still idiots heading up, and one person fainted on the cables which left us stuck on the cables exposed with a storm rolling in for an extra 10 minutes. I have an intense dislike of not being in control of my own safety on a mountain, and this was one of those cases. You are to some degree at the mercy of whichever tourist decided to attempt the cables that day.Also, the people on this hike differ from your usual hikers. Lots of drunkard students and people making noise. If you hike for the peace and quiet this is not the route for you. It has plenty of attention. I found a more pleasant hiking experience on other hikes in the park.Overall, glad I did it, but I think that there are better peaks to climb in the park, and I won't be doing it again.As a side note, we did see two big rattle snakes on the trail. If you go be careful, especially around the 5-6 mile mark. There are some rotting logs that make great trail side seats and great snake habitat.\n",

Slippery walk up the side of the waterfall took approx 90 minutes from bottom of trail to the top.  Saw hikers of all abilities and all footwear. Would have been helpful to have poles and wouldn't consider anything but hiking boots on the feet.  Saw some in flipflop and many in tennis shoes slide several feet on the descent.  Prepare to get wet but it is well worth it to see the rainbows in the mist.\n",

The ranger walk only covered a mile and a half and we wouldn't see some of the special big trees, so we backtracked and took the tram  at $18 per person. We were not disappointed by the fully narrated tour. The museum wasn't that much of interest to us, as we're not really very knowledgeable about trees, but we did learn a lot on the tour.\n",

      "Review:  With all the rains and snow that has fallen in California since the end of 2015, these falls were full, misty, and spectacular.  You can reach the base of the falls on foot from the trailhead that can be reached from the Yosemite Lodge or via the free shuttle bus which stops here.  Bring your camera and take photos all along the way.  There are trails that you can take to the top of the falls, but at this time of year not suggested.  Wait until summer.  At this time of year, you might even see some wildlife like bobcats but later in the summer they might have moved to higher ground to avoid humans.\n",
      "Review:  I love to ride up and hike back down through one of the world's great wonders.  However due to the weight of the trams adding to the soil compaction which kills these big beautiful trees, the trams will soon stop running so it will be a hike up and back.  Still worth the trip but it will be steep and not for everybody.\n",
      "Review:  By choosing this option you get the guided tour up with valuable information and the pleasure of walking down about 2 miles. early in the am is best, but check the weather report, plan on layered clothing, bring bug spray, comfortable shoes, binoculars and a good camera. expect to see wild life. Deer love this area as do ground squirrels and all kinds of birds. By walking you will see much more detail and if you pace yourself, you will be alone on the hike. The trees are beautiful and capture your attention. Just enjoy the quiet and smell of the woods. Park fee if your are under 62.\n",

      "Review:  ...are good for photos in Yosemite now. A wild fire going on since mid-July is only 4% contained and as result, smoke in your eyes, smoke in your nose, smoke in your throat, smoke coming out of your ears! If you are planning to go now, maybe you should postpone: I had driven too long to decide to give up at this point, but I was wrong. A few practical notes, if you, like me, are visiting for the first time. \tDon't even think (like I did) that you can stay outside the Park and do daily trips, distances are too big on those narrow, steep and winding roads, confined and depressing on the bottom of the tall evergreens. I gave up on the second day, left the RV in Lee Vining and rented a car in Mammoth Lakes, then found myself a room in the Yosemite Lodge at the Falls (separate review). The car rental was not pleasant: on the phone, they quoted me a $52+tax/day for an intermediate car and ended up handing me the keys to a subcompact for that same price claiming all other cars were gone (an hour after I made the reservation). But you really have no choice, Enterprise in Mammoth Lakes (airport) is the closest place for renting a car in the area. \tBring your own food and water at all times. Food, when available in the Park, is either lousy or \"closed\", like the restaurant at Wawona hotel, closing at 2pm. You would think they want customers, with the crowds of hungry tourists around. But then, this is all Monopoly with capital \"M\". All hotels in the Park are run by government. This could be surprisingly inefficient. On a good note, in Wawona I got gas for less than the average price in CA outside the Park.\tBe prepared to drive for a long time in boring surroundings and traffic.  On my first day, it took me 3.5 hours to cross the Park on 120: traffic, repairs and more repairs and trimming of the trees, several one-lane portions of the road with Pilot car, caused that.\tI know many will disagree with me, but I will take any of the Parks in Utah, Arizona, Colorado or Montana over Yosemite. It's not only the traffic, it's the views: you are either on the narrow winding road with no views, or on one of the famous viewpoints (El Capitan, Half Dome, Glacier Point) where, after you manage to park, you look at bleak solid rocks \"in your face\", threatening and intimidating, at least that's how I felt. Oh, there are also two lakes. Most of the waterfalls are dry. But the smoke is omnipresent.-----------------\n",
      "Review:  I was a little squeamish about the drive thru here. The road is beautiful and offers some real heart thumping moments. East to west is fine because you are on the inside lane. Passengers especially will really get an eyeful going west to east. Drivers should keep their eye on the road and be cautious. Wonderful scenery.\n",
      "Review:  Our timing was perfect.  We reached Yosemite Valley at midday with bright sunshine and 22 degrees Celsius (about 74 F) and were told that the Tioga Pass had been closed since the afternoon before due to snow.  We enjoyed the afternoon in Yosemite as we had planned and when it was time to head off in the direction of Bishop the authorities reopened the road. The dive is very scenic with many great views.  For us Olmsted Point looking down the valley was the highlight. After crossing the highest point on the road (3030m - 9945ft) at the eastern park gate the road takes a spectacular decent toward Mono Lake.  We travelled with a small private tour, Bundu Bashers, and our guide Jeff had the local knowledge to bring this trip to life.  I can highly recommend Bundu Bashers tour from San Francisco to Las Vegas via Tioga Pass and Death Valley.\n",
      "Review:  We came across this by accident because we were escaping the smoke from the Yosemite fires.  What a lucky find we had, this little intimate camp site overlooking a stunning lake.   Tioga Lake is breathtaking and so private with well spaced sites.  Ellery Lake was not so inviting. We later stayed in Lee Vining which was also very pleasant.\n",
      "Review:  You must take time to appreciate this entrance to Yosemite. The drive up from Lee Vining was an experience itself, with brilliant views into the valley as you climb to the top of the pass. Having crossed the top and entered the Park, stop at Tuolumne Meadows to take in the alpine scenery, and then again at Tenaya Lake and Olmsted Point. These stop offs need half a day alone as a minimum.\n",

      "Review:  I've never been especially enthusiastic about stuff like camping or the Great Outdoors in general, but Yosemite Valley really is a magical place. And to get the full effect you have to do at least one or two of the day hikes that ascend from the valley floor. Vernal Fall, for example, is only visible after you make a two- mile hike up a narrow,rugged, serpentine gorge east of the main valley. The trail isn't lengthy, but it is fairly steep---most people will be huffing and puffing by the time they reach the fall. The scenery, however, is awesome---I felt like I was somewhere near the entrance to Moria in Middle Earth. Your first glimpse of the fall comes after climbing a steep staircase of flat cut stones that have been laid in a slope above the Merced River. (I was there in April, when the river is high. It's not a big river, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in fury.) At the top of the staircase the trail makes a hairpin turn around a towering cliff and Vernal Fall comes into view. The cliff recedes away from you and curves to the left, forming a sort of sheer-sided half-bowl. Near the far end of the bowl the Merced roars off the top of the cliff and plunges straight down three hundred feet, making a huge cloud of spray that hovers in the bowl, like a watery genie. Because I was there so early in the year, many of the Park trails were still closed. So, obviously, I didn't see everything the Park has to offer. However, Vernal Fall, and the Mist Trail leading to it, were the high points of my visit. Above excellent---sublime.\n",
      "Review:  It's amazing, you don't need me to tell you that. I went for a day in April, highly recommend because that's when the waterfalls are at full blast. It's beautiful on a sunny day, with the reflection of Half Dome on the water making for a perfect picture. For another great shot, go to Tunnel View right before sunset to see the all the best parts of Yosemite lit up by the sun's fading colors. Can't wait to go back.\n",
      "Review:  Yosemite is so beautiful. If you ever get a chance to visit, take advantage.  We stayed outside of the park and drove in daily.  There is a fee of $35 to enter but is good for a week.  Go early as the parking fills up early.  Be there before 9:30 am.  There is free bus system to get you around the valley.  There are beautiful views every where you look.  We did the Vernal Falls hike.  It is fairly mellow to get to the foot bridge.  But we decided to hike to the top. That is very strenuous. It is a 3 mile hike with a 1000 ft elevation gain.  I am a fairly active person an could hardly walk for the next few days. Maybe leave that one to the end of the visit.  I also highly recommend the bus tour that takes you to the top of Glacier point. You can also buy a one way ticket if you choose to hike down. \n",

We saw it form the 4 hour bus trip to Glacier Point as well as from Tunnel View.  You can see it pretty much from anywhere in Yosemite Valley. This land mark needs to be viewed in person.  Picture do not do it justice.\n",
      "Review:  There are tons of good reviews here, and some great photos too! I've read several guide books and reviews about Yosemite National Park in general. And in everything - whether about hiking, rock-climbing, photography, family adventures, camping, geology, nature, whatever - you can't help but see special attention paid to Half Dome.  I'll just add a few tidbits 'here'.Personal experience in mid-August:  I'd wanted to do some scenic hiking and photography, but was constrained by #1 the park being closed until the day before. And #2, the Valley was very smoky when it re-opened - the day I arrived. So photography & high-exertion activities (and breathing) were limited. That said....Half Dome and El Capitan are two of the most - sorry for this overused word, but it's true - ICONIC formations, seen in product branding, Ansel Adams photographs, and rock-climbers' guides.  If you are in the Valley you'll see the whole array of formations, from many angles. Half Dome specifically is one which looms large, and is impressive from any angle or distance. It's practically right behind the Ahwahnee/Majestic and the now Half-Dome Village hotels. So... I stayed two nights (wow!) at Majestic with a porch where I could practically touch the Half Dome.  Even with smoky haze the first day (when the Valley re-opened after being closed by wildfires), I could appreciate Half Dome from the hotel, or while driving around Tioga Rd. (Olmsted Pass, Tunnel View) there is frequently an awesome view of El Capitan, Half-Dome and (when they're hydrated) Bridalveil and Yosemite falls.  Up close now, for the hiking and rock-climbing enthusiasts -  There are many trails (and that's an understatement) of all levels of difficulty, from wheelchair do-able to very long and steep hikes. Many family friendly hikes, to waterfalls or other great views of all the formations. Half Dome is internationally known as a location for a challenging rock climb. Not for amateurs. On the other side of the dome - not the part visible to the hotel, which looks like a bandshell wedge was sliced off, thus the name - there is a steep, smooth part which ascends to the summit. There is a famous cable system here for rock climbers nearing the top, visible to onlookers or photographers below. Again, 'don't try this at home'! But the serious climbers gravitate here, for this and El Capitan.If you're heading into fall/winter, know that roads close - and both the weather and the  look of Yosemite changes dramatically.Fun Fact - It's actually 80% of the dome, say geologists. It is the view from the valley, facing the 20% scoop-out, which inspires the name of \"Half Dome\". (These 2 photos show this view.)  Have fun!\n",

      "Review:  My goal for this trip was a father/son adventure that we would remember for a lifetime.  And that's exactly what it turned out to be!BACKGROUND:  Yosemite has been a favorite vacation spot for our family.  Since my son was five years old, we hiked Vernal/Nevada Fall numerous times and well understand the rigors of the Mist Trail.  Several months ago (June 2015), we camped in Upper Pines for a week and hiked the Panorama Trail (Glacier Point to the Valley floor), Upper Yosemite Fall, and Clouds Rest (from Tenaya Lake).  My son has just turned 15 years old and is in a Boy Scout troop that is very active in backpacking.  In August, his troop completed a 5-day backpacking trip in the Mammoth Lakes area.  I say all this to point out that we didn't just jump out of the car and expect to complete this hike.  In doing extensive research for the Half Dome hike, I realized that the most important thing is preparation!  HELPFUL RESOURCES:  One very helpful book is \"One Best Hike: Yosemite's Half Dome\" by Rick Deutsch (available online) which has everything you need to know about hiking Half Dome.  For another very helpful resource, Google the words \"gearing up for a half dome hike in yosemite\" and you'll find an online article by John P. DeGrazio.  Both of these resources are written by guys who have been up to Half Dome many times and really know what they are talking about, including what to bring, what to eat before the hike and during the hike, etc.PHYSICAL PREPARATION:  This is what we did... keep in mind your body is different and your mileage will vary.  In January, I started running 3 times a week in my neighborhood, about a mile and a half each time.  As the months went by, I got to the point where I was running about 6-9 miles (3x week).  This not only helped me to get in shape for our family vacation in Yosemite (30 miles of hiking) and my son's Boy Scout hikes, but it helped me to get in better shape in general, which I really needed!  My son joined his school's Cross Country team, so at the beginning of July, he started running 3-7 miles per day, about 5-6 days per week.  He also had monthly hikes with his Boy Scout troop, in addition to the 5-day backpacking trip in August that I mentioned earlier.  During the weeks right before we hiked Half Dome, we started going to the beach to do sets of stairs to strengthen our leg muscles for the steps of the Mist Trail and Sub Dome.  We started with 8 sets (up and down a long flight of 72 stairs = 1 set), then worked our way up to 14 sets.  This ended up really helping us on the hike, as well as the recovery time after the hike!  This may be more info than you need, but all this to say that if you are very intentional about your physical preparation before hiking Half Dome, you will probably have a more enjoyable experience overall.WHAT TO BRING:  First and foremost, you need your permit!  We brought 4 liters of water each - 3L in a Camelbak hydration bladder, and 1 liter of water (w/ electrolyte drink mix) in a Nalgene bottle.  Some will say to carry less water and filter on the way, but we elected to carry the extra weight so we could just go straight up.  We also brought a water filter just in case, but didn't end up using it.  We brought a lunch (Ritz crackers, jelly in a plastic tube, cheese/salami package) along with numerous trail snacks (Clif bar, fruit snacks, gummy bears, trail mix).  It's ESSENTIAL to eat snacks along the way to sustain your energy throughout this long hike.  We brought headlamps (used them in the morning when we started, and just in case we get back late) w/ extra batteries.  We brought rock climbing harnesses with 2 carabiners on each harness to clip in to the cables as a safety measure, and we each brought a pair of Nitrile gloves that would give us a good grip on the cables (do NOT depend on the discarded gloves that you might find at the base of the cables).  Though it was a clear day, we brought raingear (jacket and pants), because in the Sierras you can never be too cautious.  We brought an extra pair of hiking socks and sock liners just in case we wanted to change socks on the summit for the trip back (but didn't end up using them).  We also each brought a first aid kit (including moleskin, emergency blanket, tweezers, scissors, bandaids/bandages, etc.), as well as topo map & compass, knife, lighter, hat, sunscreen, insect repellent, toilet paper with trowel (for digging a 6-inch hole just in case), phone (get full bars of reception on the summit!), and my GoPro headcam.  As you can see, we take some things that a lot of casual hikers may not take, but we've learned through the Boy Scouts to be prepared for unforeseen emergencies that might arise.We wore synthetic quick-drying shirts and REI hiking pants (that can be converted to shorts by zipping off the legs), hiking socks and sock liners, and good sturdy hiking boots.  In the early morning, we wore fleece jackets, but they went into the daypack after we made it to the Vernal Fall Bridge.  I wore a hat, but my son opted not to, and neither of us hike with hiking poles (although quite a few hikers find their poles to be very essential in balance and easing knee strain).WHERE WE STAYED:  We stayed 2 nights in a Curry Village tent cabin.  It's a great \"base camp\" that's not too far from the trailhead (but it's still at least a half mile).  The tent cabin is pretty rustic, but you have a bed with a sheet and some blankets, a light bulb in the center, a safe for your valuables, a bear locker right outside, and close access to food and showers.  We brought our bikes from home, so in the morning we could save the additional walk and instead ride our bikes to Happy Isles (and after the hike, ride back to our tent cabin).  Since the road from Happy Isles back to Curry Village is all downhill, this works really well after the Half Dome hike as you don't have to pedal much!Another great place to \"base camp\" before Half Dome is staying in Upper Pines.  If you can stay in the last loop (furthest east), you can cut through and have a very short walk to Happy Isles.  We would have done this if we hadn't already used up our maximum number of camping days in Yosemite Valley.THE HIKE:We went to sleep the night before at around 8pm after dinner.  We woke up at 4am on September 3, the Big Day.  We ate breakfast and got ready (and it ended up taking us longer than expected), but we packed up and got on our bikes, then made it over to the official starting point (the mile marker sign part way up the trail).  Getting to even the Vernal Fall bridge is no easy task - it's short, but steep!  Then the last set of Mist Trail steps to the top of Vernal Fall will really test your legs early - these steps are large and relentless.  Once you get to the top of Vernal Fall, I would suggest only a brief stop to grab a drink/snack, because you want to get as far as possible before the day starts to heat up and the crowds begin to come.  The trek up to Nevada Fall is another relentless uphill with unending steps, especially toward the end.  For those of you who did physical preparation that involved a stairmaster or some kind of stair training... you will be glad you did!After making it to the top of Nevada Fall (where you hit the 2nd bathroom), after another short uphill you descend into Little Yosemite Valley, which provides a welcome relief of level hiking for about a mile.  This gives you time to gather your strength before the final miles of uphill begin again.After several more miles, you finally reach the base of Sub Dome, where the ranger will be checking permits.  Then it's another set of switchbacks with stair after stair, only this time it's above tree line and higher altitude, and it definitely will leave you exhausted and breathless.  There's a place when the steps end, and there's no \"trail\" from that point except to find your own way up the granite slabs until you finally reach the top of Sub Dome and get your first glimpse of the infamous cables.I have to say, the cables are more imposing when you see them in person than ANY picture or video you will ever see.  You immediately realize what you are up against.  Some people will hike up to this point and refuse to go up the cables, they are that intimidating.  But a big part of climbing Half Dome is overcoming the obstacles, not just the physical obstacles of the grueling uphill, all the stairs, etc. but also the mental obstacles of fear and \"I can't do this.\"  That's why my son and I brought our rock climbing harnesses, just for that extra peace of mind that we could clip in any time we needed.  Though we didn't end up using these harnesses, I don't regret bringing them.  Many people will go up with left hand on the left cable and right hand on the right cable, but we took the advice of Rick Deutsch and simply used the right cable, pulling ourselves up hand over hand (uses different muscles that make it easier overall).  Coming down the cables, we went backwards (facing the rock and stepping down, like repelling down the rock) which was much easier and less scary than trying to go face forward.  When we went up the cables at 10am, we had most of the cables to ourselves, whereas by 12:30pm there was much more traffic both ways, and this was toward the end of the busy season.  I would really suggest getting up early so you can make it to the base of the cables by 10:30 or 11am at the latest!The summit of Half Dome was truly an accomplishment, and there's an amazing feeling when you finally make it up there!  You realize that you made it to the top of Half Dome, that you conquered the physical challenges and you conquered the mental challenges.  And in our case, it was a father/son adventure trip that we'll never forget.  The view is great, and we definitely took some great pictures.  I actually think that some of the views from Clouds Rest (nearby peak that looks down on Half Dome) has some better overall views, but that's beside the point.  The biggest thing about reaching the summit of Half Dome, in my opinion, is not the VIEWS, but the sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT.  That's what you'll walk away with, more than any picture or video will convey.Once you finish celebrating and eating your lunch, remember that you are only halfway done with your hike!  Going down is no easy challenge, and we found that even with all of our physical preparation, the last mile or two we were pretty exhausted and our legs/feet were getting sore.  We finally made it back to our bikes around 5pm and biked back to Curry Village.  We promptly took a shower, ate dinner (there's a great ice cream shop in the Curry Village Pavilion), bought the \"I made it to the top\" T-shirt, then went to sleep!  An awesome day!For those of you who are interested, here are our major milestones:5:35am - Mileage marker (0.0 miles)5:53am - Vernal Fall bridge (1.0 miles)6:20am - Top of Vernal Fall (1.6 miles)7:10am - Top of Nevada Fall (Mist Trail/JMT junction) (2.7 miles)8:15am - Half Dome / JMT split (5.1 miles)9:10am - Base of Sub Dome (ranger checked permit) (6.8 miles)9:35am - Base of cables (took time to put on our harnesses) (7.1 miles)9:55am - Started up the cables10:15am - Top of Half Dome! (7.2 miles)Spent 2 hours at the top - lunch, pictures, hanging out12:30pm - Started down the cables (much busier!)12:50pm - Base of cables4:50pm - Back to Mileage marker sign!Please don't depend on the above numbers to predict how YOU will do.  You may go faster or slower than us, depending on your conditioning, how long you stop, etc.  But given our preparation, I was very pleased with how we came out in the end!Bottom line:  It's a great hike!  But don't take it lightly... preparation is key.  Don't just take my word for it... do your research (check out the resources I mentioned earlier) and think about what will work for YOU.  Have fun planning your trip!\n",
      "Review:  I've hiked the Mist Trail several times now, but it never gets old. Simply stunning. If you're looking for a shorter hike (under 3 miles), then the hike to Vernal Falls is the one to do. Couple of pointers: This is a very popular hike (since it's so awe inspiring and majestic and fun). The crowds won't take much away from the experience if you start later in the day, but if you start early (around 6am in the busy summer months), you will have many views of the falls and wilderness unobstructed by people. The first part is along an asphalt trail up the Merced River. Once you reach the bridge, it turns to dirt, and then shortly after that, to steep granite steps the rest of the way. It's super fun for kids, but be mindful of their activity, since there is some pretty decent exposure to cliffs below. It's a wet trail. It takes you up through the mist of the falls, so you will most likely get wet. I always bring a rain jacket, but typically don't use it. It's feels good, especially on sunny days. The trail continues to Nevada falls, if you're looking for a longer hike, and from there picks up the John Muir Trail, which is much longer, and is the route to Half Dome (which requires permits to hike, as do overnight trips on the JMT). But the JMT can also take you to both Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls, so we like to hike up the Mist Trail and return on the JMT for a looped hike. I would recommend this, since the JMT back includes Clark Point, with a most stunning view of Vernal Falls. It's also new scenery (I love loops for this), and usually a little less crowded. Pack a picnic, soak in the sunny scenery, and enjoy this iconic California natural landscape.\n",
      "Review:  We brought all our 7 kids to Yosemite for camping and Glacier Point is just perfect for them to see the whole valley they had experienced some fun hiking, swimming and eating,\n",
      "Review:  The mist trail is an iconic hike in Yosemite. The trail starts from the John Muir Trail (JMT) trail head near the happy isles shuttle stop. You can park your car at either the Trail head parking lot which usually gets full by 8:30 AM on a weekend day or at half dome village. You can either take the shuttle from half dome village or hike about a mile to the trail head on a flat trail along the road. The two most iconic water falls in Yosemite, Vernal and Nevada falls can be seen on this trail. Due to the close proximity to the falls while climbing from the foot of Vernal falls to the top of the waterfall, there is cool mist that falls on the trail and during peak run off from April through July, YOU WILL GET WET!! LIKE DRENCHED WET!! so do carry a poncho or a rain jacket. The trail itself is about 0.8 miles to the vernal falls footbridge, 1.5 miles to the top of vernal falls and 3.2 miles to Nevada falls. The initial climb is a little steep for about 15 mins and then it eases up a little about 0.4 miles in you will come across a beautiful hidden waterfall on the right do take some time to enjoy the view. The trail mostly runs along the needed river making its way down from the top of Nevada falls to the Yosemite Valley. 0.8 miles in you will come to the foot bridge that crosses the river and here you can get your first peek at Vernal falls. If you decide to turn back at this point (many people do), don’t turn back, trust me and try going up another 0.2 miles until you get to the stone steps carved into the cliff and take a call if you can climb another 0.2 miles to get an absolutely stunning full blown view of the falls !! The steps are steep and slippery at times so be very careful coming back down as you will be on the outside while climbing down. A better alternative would be to hike to the top of Vernal falls and take the JMT back down. At the top of Vernal falls you have 3 choices: 1. Come back down the way you went up but be very careful as now you will be on the outside going down, 2.Take the trail from the top of Vernal falls to the JMT at Clark point and go back down the mist trail from Clark point. 3. Continue upwards to Nevada falls and take JMT back down to Clarkpoint and down the mist trail to the trail head.I’d recommend starting very early around 7 ish from Half dome village to avoid the crowd. Around 10 Am the crowd gets so heavy it causes traffic jams at the base of Vernal falls. Stay safe out there and enjoy your hike!! \n",
      "Review:  Really like the trail to see the falls.  Some steep sections and slippery in sections.  We didn’t go right to the top (close) a tad too slippery without poles and a few too many impatient peeps for me.  Still happy with what we saw though. Bathrooms were closed (sign notifying at the head of the trail).  There is water there to re-fill which was great! Would recommend and go again.\n",

      "Review:  I've never been especially enthusiastic about stuff like camping or the Great Outdoors in general, but Yosemite Valley really is a magical place. And to get the full effect you have to do at least one or two of the day hikes that ascend from the valley floor. Vernal Fall, for example, is only visible after you make a two- mile hike up a narrow,rugged, serpentine gorge east of the main valley. The trail isn't lengthy, but it is fairly steep---most people will be huffing and puffing by the time they reach the fall. The scenery, however, is awesome---I felt like I was somewhere near the entrance to Moria in Middle Earth. Your first glimpse of the fall comes after climbing a steep staircase of flat cut stones that have been laid in a slope above the Merced River. (I was there in April, when the river is high. It's not a big river, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in fury.) At the top of the staircase the trail makes a hairpin turn around a towering cliff and Vernal Fall comes into view. The cliff recedes away from you and curves to the left, forming a sort of sheer-sided half-bowl. Near the far end of the bowl the Merced roars off the top of the cliff and plunges straight down three hundred feet, making a huge cloud of spray that hovers in the bowl, like a watery genie. Because I was there so early in the year, many of the Park trails were still closed. So, obviously, I didn't see everything the Park has to offer. However, Vernal Fall, and the Mist Trail leading to it, were the high points of my visit. Above excellent---sublime.\n",

      "Review:  El Capitan is one of if not the largest single piece of granite on the planet. To stand and look is always awe inspiring. I tell everyone who goes to yosemite to stop at every turnout and get out of the car and take the time to look in all directions. The views are incredible and the  sight of El Capitan is mind boggling. With you Binoculars be sure to scour the face of the rock for climbers. They are always there, and the enormity of the face of El Capitan makes the first climber hard to spot. Then magically you can find many climbers. What a view, what a place, Yosemite\n",

(not sure how one would eat, sleep and pee while climbing for 45 days). the record is 2.5 hours it seems. I am not sure if there are trails to go to the top of the rock. Must be fascinating for rock climbers.\n",

      "Review:  This hike produces some of the most outstanding views in the U.S. We took the mist trail up and the John Muir trail down. Take your lunch and eat at the emerald pool at the top of the falls. My fitness tracker read at the end 18,800 steps =8.14 miles and 78 flights of stairs. I probably did some extraneous walking that might have amounted to 1,500 of the 18,800 steps. It's a tough uphill climb but take lots of breaks if for no other reason than to look around you and take pictures. Also, wear good hiking boots so your toes don't hurt on the downhill side. The downhill is a different kind of brutal from the uphill side. I have arthritis in my knees and so took hiking poles especially for the downhill. Soak your feet in the river when you get to the bottom - the ice melt will help reduce any stress on your feet.  Park at Half Dome and take the shuttle to Happy Isles - a 5 minute ride.\n",

My husband and 13 year old daughter both turned around just over halfway due to pain in their knees. Once we made it to the bridge my 16 year old son wanted to go on up to Vernal Falls for the full experience. It says 1.5 miles further but most of it is straight up on rock steps. You also have to come back down that way. It was definitely worth it. The view was amazing and one of a kind. I would not recommend this hike for young children due to the open cliffs or anyone with health issues. You will put your body through an intense workout. There is one place to refill your water bottle on the way up. \n",
      "Review:  This hike was the best hike I have ever experienced!! We stopped a lot to take pictures and videos & sat down a few times to relax for a short while. We hiked from the parking lot, to Vernal Falls, to the top of Nevada Falls, & then back down to the parking lot. It took us a little over 8 hours. We left for our hike at 5:30am to beat the crowds & it was well worth it! The crowds on the way down were unbelievable at points! The pretty much one way section of stairs were difficult to maneuver with the line of people coming up them. The top of Nevada Falls, on the bridge above the falls, brought me to tears! I have seen a lot of beautiful places, but I believe this specific spot was the most beautiful place I have ever seen. It was quite magical! People weren’t asking how far we were hiking, they were asking how far UP we were hiking! Lol. Almost all of the hike to the top of Nevada Falls is uphill. It climbs almost 2000 feet in elevation from the beginning of the trail! You will get wet near Vernal Falls by the waterfall. It was the most difficult hike, but the most beautiful hike I have experienced! The views along the way make every step worth while! Make sure you take some snacks & some water (or a water filtration system) for the long hike! A rain jacket came in handy too! Be careful in the hike! Of all of Yosemite, this trail is where most of the deaths occur. Some from natural causes, but a lot from people going over safety barriers for pictures, or just wanting to get a little closer to the edge to get the perfect picture. Be safe & have fun!!\n",
      "Review:  SPECTACULAR TREES. It’s to bad the NPS has not made accommodations for seniors and the disabled. The only accommodation, is to provide a parking lot that’s available if you have a disability placard. The trails are not wheelchair accessible or elderly friendly.  I’m a 66 yr old female in relatively good condition, however it’s a pretty tough walk to get up to the grizzly giant, let alone any further than that. My husband who has a bad back could only walk a short distance. I really find it hard to believe that anyone other than young adults can get the full effect of the awesomeness of the park. \n",
      "Review:  We were lucky enough to snag a half dome permit 2 days before the hike (daily lottery.)  We parked at the happy isle parking lot and reached the trail head at 4am, took us 5 hours to reach the top of half dome.  It was pitch black out for about 2 hours...all we used was 1 head lamp and that was plenty of light.  Its a well marked easy trailer...you dont exactly need a spot light to find your way.  We took the mist trail to John Muir trail up...then the falls trail back.  The falls trail is much more difficult.  I couldnt imagine taking that trail up in the pitch black.  Its much more difficult terrain (all steep steps and switchbacks.).  No thanks.  Its a mile shorter but much more strenuous.  Take the John Muir trail up!The trail up through the John Muir way is really easy and not very strenuous at all.  I hurt my knee earlier in the week and had no issues, didnt have to use walking poles, etc.  I do about zero cardio at the gym and was not breathing heavy at all...until the last half mile.The last half mile is when you start to to ascend the sub dome then half dome.  Sub dome is a lot of switchbacks with stairs...pretty darn steep.  Once you climb that and arrive at the cables take a couple minute break to get a drink and relax just to be safe.  If you didnt bring gloves grab some up by the cables near the rock.  You wont miss it.  If you're early enough there should be plenty of pairs to choose from...if you get there later in the day they may all be taken.The cables themselves/half dome is pretty intimidating.  It is really steep.  At first you may be frightened and unsure of yourself but as you go you'll get in a groove as to how to grip the cables and move up the slick granite wall.  I had bald sneakers and it was a little difficult because I kept slipping.  I did change into my other shoes I brought along on the way down and they gripped much better.  Just take a break on each of the boards on the way up if you need to.  And whatever you do...do not let go of the cables and do no go outside of the cables like some people do!  Its slopped on each side...if you start to fall off you have a very small chance of survival.  It took us about 15 minutes to climb the cables.  Once at the top enjoy yourself and eat/drink.  There are also small critters that try to steal your food if you leave stuff out unattended...so if you're going to leave your backpack behind make sure everything is sealed.  Or you can do what I did and feel the little guys.  They're funny and I had plenty of food to go around.  And for the goobers who like to say that feeding wildlife is killing them...uh news flash...these little critters arent apex predators!  It doesnt matter if they become dependent on people feeding them.  If they want food all they have to do is walk under a tree and pick up a nut you dummy.  They arent chasing down other animals to prey on.  Zip it.On the way down the cables you'll want to go backwards, gripping both sides of the cable.  You'll also get in a groove and fly down the cables.  Before you know it you'll be back at the bottom looking up.  Some other maybe helpful things:2 of us shared 3 liters of water along with a gatorade and 2 small bottles of water.  When we arrived back at the hotel I pulled out my bladder bag and there was maybe a gulp of water left.  We planned it just right.  If we had to do it again Id bring an additional 2 liters of water to be safe.  But everyone is different so you may need less than this...you may need more.Shoes:  Like I said I wore comfortable semi bald shoes and had no issues till scaling half dome.  You do not need hiking boots designed to withstand a nuclear blast.  Wear something comfortable.  When I got to the bottom of the cables I switched out of my \"hiking\" sneakers and back to my more comfortable worn out shoes for the hike home.  Even going the falls trail which is steep...had no issues.  Also, you're not going to experience much water walking on the trail up and back...so theres no need for those gore tex leathery hot on your feet material that can deflect bullets.  Any comfy sneaker is fine.  No one will care about your $300 footwear.  After 16+ miles you'll be wishing for your cheapo comfy wilson shoes from the dollar store.Some have mentioned not to bring a heavy camera (dslr.)  My question is...why not?  We carried one and it didnt bother us one bit.  Not everyone wants to view pictures on a 4 inch cell phone.Also...do not play in the water anywhere near the top of a waterfall.  Better yet stay the hell out of the water...and for parents, keep your kids out of the water unless you're at the bottom of the valley.  There are signs everywhere about the dangers.  You will be really hot by the end of the walk and a quick dip in the creek is tempting...do not do it.  People die every single year in Yosemite because of this.  Actually more people die from waterfalls in yosemite than from half dome.  For those who die and are old enough to know the dangers of getting in the water...well thats just Darwin at work.Thats about all i have...you do not need to be in super shape to do this hike.  Like I said...15 miles of this trail is easy...the last .5 up and .5 down is tough...so anyone thinking they're awesome for doing this hike needs a reality check.  Just pace yourself, start early enough, and have fun.\n",

      "Review:  I've never been especially enthusiastic about stuff like camping or the Great Outdoors in general, but Yosemite Valley really is a magical place. And to get the full effect you have to do at least one or two of the day hikes that ascend from the valley floor. Vernal Fall, for example, is only visible after you make a two- mile hike up a narrow,rugged, serpentine gorge east of the main valley. The trail isn't lengthy, but it is fairly steep---most people will be huffing and puffing by the time they reach the fall. The scenery, however, is awesome---I felt like I was somewhere near the entrance to Moria in Middle Earth. Your first glimpse of the fall comes after climbing a steep staircase of flat cut stones that have been laid in a slope above the Merced River. (I was there in April, when the river is high. It's not a big river, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in fury.) At the top of the staircase the trail makes a hairpin turn around a towering cliff and Vernal Fall comes into view. The cliff recedes away from you and curves to the left, forming a sort of sheer-sided half-bowl. Near the far end of the bowl the Merced roars off the top of the cliff and plunges straight down three hundred feet, making a huge cloud of spray that hovers in the bowl, like a watery genie. Because I was there so early in the year, many of the Park trails were still closed. So, obviously, I didn't see everything the Park has to offer. However, Vernal Fall, and the Mist Trail leading to it, were the high points of my visit. Above excellent---sublime.\n",
      "Review:  The Upper Yosemite Falls Trail in Yosemite Valley is one of the oldest trails in the park and remains a popular challenge for experienced and novice hikers alike.  That said, this trail is NOT recommended for those who have little hiking experience or are out for a casual walk.  This is a rugged, steep trail that requires suitable equipment and a pretty decent fitness level; it is rated “strenuous” for good reason.Due to the rocky (and in some places slippery) condition of the trail, sturdy hiking shoes are a must.  You will also need to carry plenty of water; wearing a hat and sunscreen would also be a good idea.The trail begins near Camp Four and almost immediately leads into a series of approximately 40 (!) switchbacks.  You then proceed along a long (but not extremely steep) uphill stretch until you come to several more very steep switchbacks.  Right around the time you begin wondering if you’re actually making any progress you reach Columbia Rock, where you can stop and enjoy some outstanding views of Yosemite Valley.  That encouragement should hopefully give you the energy to take on a few more very steep climbs before the trail begins to level off and actually go downhill a bit.  When you begin to go uphill again you turn a corner and are suddenly treated to a magnificent view of the Upper Fall (unless you’re visiting during the late Summer or early Fall when the falls are dry).  My wife and I decided to stop here, but our son was determined to reach the top and continued on.  From this point you will have to ascend another set of several dozen switchbacks which (according to our son) are more challenging than the set at the beginning of the trail.  At the top, a view of the roaring waters cascading over the fall awaits along with a genuine feeling of accomplishment.The most helpful advice I can give regarding this hike is to take your time and rest when you need it.  There is no prize for finishing first here, and by taking your time you’re able to take in and appreciate the remarkable scenery, which will remind you what a special place Yosemite can be.\n",
      "Review:  The Falls are everything you have heard and more.  Breathtaking in their beauty when they are flowing in the Spring.  The water is from the snow.  Once that is gone, the Falls dry up.  There is an easy, wheel chair accessible trail to the base of the Lower Falls - a great place for pictures and to see Yosemite Creek.  There is also a trail to the base of the Upper Falls, which continues up to the top of the Upper Falls and the Yosemite Point.  The Park Service labels this trail as extremely strenuous and they are right.  It is 3.5 miles one way, 2600 feet up in elevation (that's 2 trips up the Empire State Building stairs)' mostly stone and switchbacks.  I won't claim to be in the best shape, and definitely took lots of breaks, but it took us 11 hours round trip, not the 6-8 hours the Park Service suggested.  So if you plan to go, be honest with yourself about how long it might take and take lots of water.  So, was it worth it?  You bet.  Absolutely beautiful views at both the lower and upper falls, and along the way.  If you are brave enough, you can hang over the top of the Falls, with one hand on the iron rail that you needed to walk the narrow path to get there.  And of course you get bragging rights - you made it to the top of the Upper Falls, not like all those who turned back at the Lower Falls summit.\n",
      "Review:  When you come to Yosemite, Yosemite Falls will be one of those attractions that is almost mandatory. Most people THINK of the falls when they think of Yosemite park and, especially in the late Spring, you won't be disappointed. Right now, the falls are running at a good volume however, with only 34 percent of normal snow pack in 2014, there may not be much water by the end of Summer. At 1,430 feet, the Upper Falls command a view from numerous locations throughout the park while the Middle Cascades at 675 feet and the Lower Falls at 320 feet may not be as dramatic but are still beautiful. If you have a good digital single reflex camera, try this... get into your camera settings and take a few pictures of the falls in \"monochrome\". Then, leaving your camera set in monochrome, manually set your camera for a \"1/15\" second shutter speed, hold the camera real steady or use a tripod and shoot a couple pictures of the falls. Slowing your shutter speed will soften the water as it makes it's journey  from the top of the falls to the bottom. Access the lower falls near Yosemite Lodge while hiking to the upper falls will require a tough and crowded 3.5 mile hike from near Camp 4.\n",
      "Review:  A couple weeks ago, my family and I took a hike to the top of Yosemite Falls. It was very hard but very rewarding once we got to the top! The hike is about 7 miles roundtrip and took about six hours including a one hour break at the top. The beginning part is nice and shady, but most of the hike is in the sun and can get very hot. Going up is very challenging because it is very steep and it is mostly switchbacks up a steep cliff in the sun. The hike up took us about 2-3 hours with lots of breaks. When we got to the top there were amazing views of the valley but you couldn't see much of the falls itself. You climb out onto this ledge where you're standing on the side of the top of the falls, so you couldn't see straight down. It scary at the top because there isn't much railing. There is also a cool bridge over the river and lots of places at the top to sit down, eat some snacks, and enjoy the view. The best views of the waterfall are along the hike, and at one point you can see the entire falls and feel the mist. The hike down is a lot easier and only took about 1.5 hours, half the time it took to get up. The hike was fun but I don't recommend it for people who aren't going to go all the way to the top. There are some great views along the way, but the long and tiring hike isn't really worth it until you get to the top. This hike also isn't good for small children because it is long and steep with lots of switchbacks. If you are looking for a really lush and scenic hike, this one isn't great because the views are the same all the way and its pretty dry and boring most of the way. TIPS:*Bring LOTS of water- we went through 8 bottles!*Wear sturdy shoes- There are lots of rocks and it is pretty steep so it is easy to twist an ankle*Bring snacks- It's a fairly long hike so bring snacks along the way or for the top\n",

      "Review:  This waterfall is very close to the main lodging area of the valley, and as such, is often crowded. Try to go early or late in the day to avoid the crowds. The trails offer a few different views of different levels of the falls, and people can often be seen walking the rocks at the base of the falls. makes for great pictures from any angle, a must see for anyone in Yosemite valley.\n",
      "Review:  One of the best hikes I have ever taken. This is a very strenuous hike if yiu go all the wy to the top of Nevada Falls, so be prepared with water, hiking boots and hiking sticks. Most importantly, try not to do the hike in the middle of the day because of heat and crowds. The first part is roughly 2 miles to the top of Vernal Falls. Once at the top you'll have the option to hike another 2 miles to the top of Nevada Falls. Also note, if yiu reach the top of Nevada Falls you can return on the John Muir trail which gives panoramic views of the valley. Views are stunning, and you will get very wet from the mist. Some parts of the trail are steep and wet from the mist. We went at 6 AM and there was hardly anyone on the trail. Upon returning, the trail became EXTREMELY crowded and gridlocked in the heat of the day, and this was on a Tuesday. Definitely start early, especially in the summer!\n",
      "Review:  It's been years since we visited Yosemite.  The valley with the crowds and traffic during \"the season\" no longer beckons us from San Francisco - we have memories of quieter times and fewer backpackers on the back-country trails.  We'll go back during off-season, some time.So we went to check out the revamped Mariposa Grove -- with the new emphasis on hiking rather than on the old Disneyland-like tram to ride through the giant sequoias.We stayed for 2 nights at a nearby lodge/hotel and arrived at the Yosemite south gate and shuttle parking lot to the grove at 8:15am on a Friday before most schools let out for summer (June 7). There were only a few cars in the parking lot; a 15 minute wait for the shuttle.  The guide office wasn't open and trail maps not available, so we took photos of the trail map posted on the wall.The details from here on are for people looking for suggestions of how to spend an easy day in the grove.  We're in our 60s, do a lot of walking, and did not find what we did as \"strenuous,\" even though that's what the NPS trail markers calls our route.  We just kept hiking because it seemed relatively easy, felt good, and we had energy and the desire to do more. And brought lunch and water.   Total time was about 6 hours and about 7 miles.  We spent a lot of time dawdling -- taking in what we were looking at... and taking pictures.  **Note: whenever possible, take one of the perimeter trails or similar less-traveled trails. If you're seeking peace and solitude in the giant sequoias, this is probably more what you're looking for.  They are well-maintained.  We didn't see any evidence that the trails have been used with horses, despite the signs marking this as a horse trail.  There were very few people on the perimeter trails when we were there on a weekday with school still in session.We started the regular Big Trees Loop trail (easy, about 2 miles total), then kept going on the Mariposa Grove Trail at the Grizzly Giant.  But the MGT is basically an old tram road with the asphalt stripped off -- and not very interesting.  So, on the MGT, across from the branch off to the California Tunnel Tree, we headed onto a smaller trail to the \"Perimeter Trail\" and kept going to the Mariposa Grove Cabin.  The perimeter trail was well maintained and more what we were looking for: a sweet hike through the woods on a narrow hiking trail.  Not really \"strenuous\" in our book... just a moderate grade climb uphill.    The Mariposa Grove was inspiring... and the cabin story fascinating.  We got great suggestions from the Conservancy volunteer there about trails.From the cabin, we took a portion of the Guardian's Loop trail to the Telescope Tree and the Fallen Wawona Tunnel Tree, shifting whenever possible to cutoff trails or the Perimeter Trail.  Then, from the Galen Clark Tree, took the Mariposa Grove Trail (old tram road) the 1/2 mile to Wawona Point.  The view from Wawona Point is worth the walk -- and it's a great place to have a lunch or snack that you brought.Heading back, we avoided the road-wide Mariposa Grove Trail for the lesser-traveled trails.  At the Faithful Couple tree, we took the smaller trail until it joined up with the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail, then back to the start and shuttle stop.  We got back to the shuttle parking lot at 2:30 and saw quite a few open parking spaces.  Then headed back to the lodge/hotel and a beeline to the hot tub and pool.So why give this a 4 star instead of 5?  I love this place, but giving it a rating involves comparing.  And to me there's nothing that beats the intimacy, beauty, and peace of Muir Woods and the redwood grove in the early morning hours before 8:00am and the crowds begin to arrive.  Maybe it's the number of groves/trees in that tiny amount of valley space, or the moisture from the fog, or the way the redwoods climb to the sky (redwoods are taller, sequoias are thicker).  This close-up intimacy of Muir Woods is a very different experience than the much wider area and grandeur-of-a-different-sort of Mariposa Grove, where you happen upon groves of giant sequoias in the dry elevations of the Sierras.  It's all good.\n",
      "Review:  Our trip of Yosemite started at South entrance which is where Grove is located. This was beautiful place to hike. Day we went there was light snow on the ground and sun was peaking thru. The trees were beautiful! The shuttle into the Grove is very efficient and stays on schedule. This is must see spot in the park. We visited in off season and during week so had no problems. If going on weekend or summer come early or you might not have place to park. \n",
      "Review:  From any angle, any viewpoint, El Capitan is truly a majestic marvel of glacially sculpted granite.  You an see it when you first drive through the Tunnel as you make your way into the Yosemite valley...but El Capitan is also magnificent from many other vantage points throughout the valley.  And it's almost impossible to take a bad photograph.  Dont' miss !!!  FYI, the best time to visit Yosemite NP would be in May, before Memorial Day weekend hits and the crowds start to become overwhelming; or in the fall, sometime after Labor Day weekend, when the crowds have thinned.  But be advised...if you want to see Upper/Lower Yosemite Falls you will need to do this in the spring, when the runoff is still going strong...otherwise, by September, the falls are completely dry...the drought has really had a major affect on the water falls.\n",
